This section includes several lessons:

- **1 Your first server**: In this initial lesson, you'll learn how to create your first server and use the inspector tool to test and debug it. [Go to the lesson](01-first-server/README.md)

- **2 Client**: This lesson teaches you how to write a client that can connect to your server. [Go to the lesson](02-client/README.md)

- **3 Client with LLM**: Learn how to enhance your client by integrating an LLM, enabling it to "negotiate" with your server on actions to take. [Go to the lesson](03-llm-client/README.md)

- **4 Consuming a server in GitHub Copilot Agent mode using Visual Studio Code**: Explore how to run your MCP Server directly within Visual Studio Code. [Go to the lesson](04-vscode/README.md)

- **5 stdio Transport Server**: stdio transport is the recommended standard for MCP server-to-client communication, offering secure subprocess-based communication. [Go to the lesson](05-stdio-server/README.md)

- **6 HTTP Streaming with MCP (Streamable HTTP)**: Discover modern HTTP streaming, progress notifications, and how to implement scalable, real-time MCP servers and clients using Streamable HTTP. [Go to the lesson](06-http-streaming/README.md)

- **7 Utilizing AI Toolkit for VSCode**: Learn how to consume and test your MCP Clients and Servers using the AI Toolkit for VSCode. [Go to the lesson](07-aitk/README.md)

- **8 Testing**: This lesson focuses on various methods to test your server and client. [Go to the lesson](08-testing/README.md)

- **9 Deployment**: Explore different approaches to deploying your MCP solutions. [Go to the lesson](09-deployment/README.md)

- **10 Advanced server usage**: Dive into advanced server usage techniques. [Go to the lesson](./10-advanced/README.md)

- **11 Auth**: Learn how to implement simple authentication, from Basic Auth to using JWT and RBAC. Start here, then explore advanced topics in Chapter 5 and apply additional security hardening recommendations from Chapter 2. [Go to the lesson](./11-simple-auth/README.md)

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs. Think of MCP as a USB-C port for AI applications—it offers a standardized way to connect AI models to various data sources and tools.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Set up development environments for MCP in C#, Java, Python, TypeScript, and JavaScript
- Build and deploy basic MCP servers with custom features (resources, prompts, and tools)
- Create host applications that connect to MCP servers
- Test and debug MCP implementations
- Address common setup challenges and their solutions
- Connect your MCP implementations to popular LLM services

## Setting Up Your MCP Environment

Before starting with MCP, it's essential to prepare your development environment and understand the basic workflow. This section will guide you through the initial setup steps for a smooth start with MCP.

### Prerequisites

Before diving into MCP development, ensure you have:

- **Development Environment**: For your chosen language (C#, Java, Python, TypeScript, or JavaScript)
- **IDE/Editor**: Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ, Eclipse, PyCharm, or any modern code editor
- **Package Managers**: NuGet, Maven/Gradle, pip, or npm/yarn
- **API Keys**: For any AI services you plan to use in your host applications

### Official SDKs

In the upcoming chapters, you'll encounter solutions built using Python, TypeScript, Java, and .NET. Below are the officially supported SDKs.

MCP provides official SDKs for multiple languages:
- [C# SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/csharp-sdk) - Maintained in collaboration with Microsoft
- [Java SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/java-sdk) - Maintained in collaboration with Spring AI
- [TypeScript SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk) - The official TypeScript implementation
- [Python SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk) - The official Python implementation
- [Kotlin SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/kotlin-sdk) - The official Kotlin implementation
- [Swift SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/swift-sdk) - Maintained in collaboration with Loopwork AI
- [Rust SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/rust-sdk) - The official Rust implementation

## Key Takeaways

- Setting up an MCP development environment is straightforward with language-specific SDKs
- Building MCP servers involves creating and registering tools with clear schemas
- MCP clients connect to servers and models to leverage extended capabilities
- Testing and debugging are crucial for reliable MCP implementations
- Deployment options range from local development to cloud-based solutions
